## 🔑 Key Components
### 1️⃣ Race Strategy Agent
- Optimizes race strategies based on track conditions, weather, and opponent data.
- Uses reinforcement learning and predictive analytics to make real-time decisions.

### 2️⃣ Car Performance Predictor
- Predicts vehicle performance metrics based on engine specs, aerodynamics, and historical lap times.
- Utilizes regression models and neural networks for precise estimation.

### 3️⃣ Driver Behavior Model
- Simulates driver actions such as overtaking, braking, and acceleration strategies.
- Analyzes past race data to model driver tendencies.

### 4️⃣ Data Processing Utilities
- Includes preprocessing scripts for cleaning and structuring race data.
- Feature engineering methods to extract meaningful insights.

### 5️⃣ Machine Learning Models
- Implements neural networks and traditional machine learning models for classification and prediction.
- Trained models are stored in the `models/` directory.
